# OPL-Launcher-BDM

OPL-Launcher-BDM reads `hdd0:/__common/OPL/conf_hdd.cfg` to launch `$OPL/OPNPS2LD.ELF` and uses OPL's `autoLaunchBDMGame` function.

**Note:**
This is currently a test app, as `autoLaunchBDMGame` is not yet functional.

## Usage:
Rename `OPL-Launcher-BDM.elf` to match the game you wish to launch. For example:

- `SLUS_203.75.Mister Mosquito.iso-CD.elf`

or

- `SLUS_203.94.Ecco the Dolphin.iso-DVD.elf`
